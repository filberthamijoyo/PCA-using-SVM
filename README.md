# PCA using SVM
 This project showcases the implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR). It covers data preprocessing, model training, dimensionality reduction, and performance evaluation for regression tasks. The code is modular, with clear steps for dataset handling, model training, and evaluation. It also includes visualization for better understanding of the results.
